# Bootcamp-Assignment-2

This repo is for the VBA assignment for the Bootcamp. There are two files. One is the VBA script and the other is a screenshot of the yearly data. 

I was not able to complete all the calculations properly. You will notice the numbers off for the percentages and the total volume. I was able to grasp the overall concepts of creating a for loop that identifies the two different tickers. Pull in the fields into a variable for use in creation of the columns. But my approach of nested If statements led to an overly complex code that became frustrating to work with. 

This morning I had a very helpful BCS session Deborah(Daina) who helped walk me through the end code for grabbing the min/max percentage and max total volumne. I attempted to rewrite the total volume code and percentage code with these lessons, but consistently had errors with all the if statements. It is all pulling from the right places, just off on the totals. I also understand how the total volume should count up for each ticker and then rest the volume variable back to 0 before starting the new ticker. I have just spent too much time on this project at this point and need to just submit what I have.
